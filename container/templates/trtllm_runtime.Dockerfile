# Upgrade DALI past its own media-codec cleanup. Upstream restricted DALI's
# vendored ffmpeg build to drop the software h264/hevc/aac decoders
# (NVIDIA/DALI_deps#162, NVIDIA/DALI#6352), first released in 2.1.1; the base
# image here carries 2.1.0, which predates it.
#
# Upgrade rather than remove. The vendored libav*/libsw* set cannot be trimmed
# on its own -- every one of them is DT_NEEDED by libdali.so and its siblings, so
# deleting the codec libraries breaks `import nvidia.dali` outright -- and while
# nothing in this image imports DALI today, it belongs to TensorRT-LLM rather
# than to us. A version bump removes the codec surface without taking a package
# out of someone else's image.
#
# Measured on the shipped image: 2.1.0 registers 446 decoders including h264,
# hevc, aac, aac_fixed and aac_latm; 2.1.1 and 2.2.0 each register 440 with all
# five absent and vp8/vp9/mjpeg/av1 retained.
#
# Pinned exactly, not a floor. `>=2.1.1` resolves to whatever is newest -- 2.2.0
# at the time of writing -- which is a minor-version jump into a component this
# repo does not own, taken silently at build time. 2.1.1 is the smallest change
# that removes the decoders, so it is the one to take.
#
# A pin can go stale in the one direction that matters: if TensorRT-LLM later
# ships a base image with a newer DALI, installing 2.1.1 over it is a downgrade.
# The check below turns that into a build failure with instructions rather than a
# silent regression, which also makes this block self-retiring -- when upstream
# catches up, the build tells whoever is looking to delete it.
#
# THIS BLOCK IS TRANSITIONAL. It exists because the base image predates upstream's
# own cleanup. The guards after it and the bundled-libavcodec assertion in
# tests/dependencies/test_no_software_video_codecs.py are NOT transitional: they
# are the permanent statement of what this image may contain, and they must
# outlive the workaround.
#
# System interpreter for the same reason as the opencv removal above: with
# VIRTUAL_ENV set, plain pip targets the venv and leaves the system-site copy in
# place. The guard enumerates what the library actually registers rather than
# trusting the version string, so a wheel that reintroduces a decoder fails the
# build. Mirrored by the pre_runtime whiteout below, which matters more here than
# for a deletion: DALI's libraries are hash-named, so an upgrade RENAMES them and
# the squash COPY would otherwise leave the old codec-carrying copy in place
# beside the new one.

#
# System interpreter for the same reason as the opencv removal and the DALI
# upgrade above: with VIRTUAL_ENV set, plain pip targets /opt/dynamo/venv and
# leaves the system-site copy in place. The venv is --system-site-packages, so a
# venv-only install would shadow the old version at import time while leaving it
# on disk under dist-packages, where the image inventory reads it. The guard
# checks the system interpreter specifically, so a venv-only install fails here.
#
# Mirrored by the pre_runtime whiteout below. An upgrade renames the metadata
# directory (aiohttp-3.13.5.dist-info -> aiohttp-3.14.3.dist-info) and the squash
# COPY only replaces paths that match, so without dropping the old tree first the
# base image's dist-info would ship alongside the new one.
#
# Checked against the base's own constraints (datasets, fsspec), which cap nothing
# here. cp312 manylinux_2_28 wheels exist for x86_64 and aarch64, so neither
# architecture builds from source.
# The guard asserts on dist-info directories, not on an importable version,
# because those directories are what an image inventory reads and they are what
# a venv-only install or a missed whiteout would leave wrong. It requires exactly
# one, in range, so a surviving old copy beside the new one fails the build.
# Version-compared rather than glob-matched: a glob range silently stops matching
# at the end of the series it was written for.

# Same treatment, same reason, for the rest of the packages requirements.trtllm.txt
# floors. The comment at the top of that file says naming a package there is enough
# to refresh the bundled copy in place. For these it is not: those installs run with
# VIRTUAL_ENV set, so they land in /opt/dynamo/venv and the base image's copy stays
# on disk under dist-packages, which is where the image inventory reads. The floors
# and the shipped versions disagreed on every one of them:
#
#   pillow          floor >=12.3.0   bundled 12.2.0
#   mistune         floor >=3.3.0    bundled 3.2.1
#   tornado         floor >=6.5.6    bundled 6.5.5
#   jupyter-server  floor >=2.20.0   bundled 2.18.2
#   jupyterlab      floor >=4.5.10   bundled 4.5.7
#   gitpython       floor >=3.1.58   bundled 3.1.50
#   soupsieve       floor >=2.8.4    bundled 2.8.3
#
# aiohttp was the only floor in that file that took, and it took because of the
# explicit system-interpreter install above rather than because of the floor.
#
# Named packages only, and --no-deps keeps that literal: without it pip's default
# only-if-needed strategy will upgrade a transitive dependency whenever a newly
# selected release wants one the base image does not satisfy, which both re-solves
# part of upstream's graph and leaves that dependency's old metadata behind (it is
# not in the whiteout list, which names only these packages).
#
# --no-deps is only safe if the selected release cannot introduce a dependency the
# base image lacks, so every floor carries an upper bound at the next minor. An
# open floor does not stay on the patch line: `jupyterlab>=4.5.10` resolves to
# 4.6.3 today, which adds a hard runtime dependency on jupyter-builder that the
# base image does not bundle, and with --no-deps that dependency is simply absent
# -- `jupyter lab` then raises ImportError from a top-level import in commands.py.
# The caps keep each package on the line its fix shipped in (4.5.9/4.5.10 for
# jupyterlab, 2.8.4 for soupsieve, and so on), so they cost no remediation.
#
# --no-cache-dir because the base image sets no PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR; without it these
# RUNs leave wheel blobs in /root/.cache/pip and `COPY --from=runtime_full / /`
# carries them into the shipped image. Extending the whiteout cannot fix that --
# the overlay re-adds runtime_full's copy.
#
# Mirrored by the pre_runtime whiteout below for the same dist-info-rename reason,
# and re-asserted after the overlay -- see the post-overlay guard near the end of
# this file for why the in-stage guard cannot cover the whiteout.
#
# The guard normalizes distribution names before comparing (PEP 503: runs of
# -_. collapse and case folds), because the on-disk directories do not agree on
# spelling -- jupyter_server-*.dist-info and GitPython-*.dist-info both appear.
# It requires exactly one dist-info per package and a version inside the declared
# range, so a venv-only install, a missed whiteout, an old copy surviving beside
# the new one, or a resolution past the cap all fail the build here rather than in
# a scan afterwards. aiohttp is carried in the same dict for parity: it is managed
# by the same mechanism and its own guard above is in-stage only.

# DALI is here for a different reason: runtime_full UPGRADES it rather than
# removing it, and its vendored libraries are hash-named
# (libavcodec-847b0373.so.62 -> libavcodec-7e11e4e3.so.62). An overlay COPY only
# replaces paths that match, so without dropping the old tree first, the base
# image's 2.1.0 libraries — the ones carrying h264/hevc/aac — would ship
# alongside the upgraded ones and the upgrade would buy nothing.
#
# aiohttp is here for the DALI reason, not the opencv one: runtime_full upgrades
# it in system site, and the version-stamped metadata directory is renamed by the
# upgrade (aiohttp-3.13.5.dist-info -> aiohttp-3.14.3.dist-info). The overlay COPY
# would leave the base image's dist-info beside the new one, and the inventory
# reads that directory, so the upgrade would not show.
#
# Its runtime dependencies are listed for the same reason. pip upgrades those too
# when the new aiohttp requires versions the base does not carry, and each rename
# has the same doubling problem. Dropping them here is free: the overlay restores
# whatever runtime_full holds, so listing one that did not move costs nothing and
# omitting one that did would leave stale metadata behind.

# then reports version 2.1.0 while carrying both. Verified by building this

# Post-overlay guard for the system-site floor whiteouts above, for the same
# reason DALI has one: the in-stage assertion runs inside runtime_full, before
# `COPY --from=runtime_full / /`, so by construction it cannot observe a whiteout
# mistake. A duplicate only exists after the overlay re-adds the base image's
# copy beside the upgraded one, and the metadata directory rename is what makes
# the copy survive. Two real cases were shipped past the in-stage guard before
# this existed: a case-sensitive `GitPython-*` that never matched the base
# image's lowercase `gitpython-*.dist-info`, and `PIL.libs` for a directory
# auditwheel actually names `pillow.libs`.
#
# Same normalized comparison as the in-stage guard, re-run here where the
# duplicate can appear, and carrying aiohttp too -- it is managed by the same
# mechanism and its own guard is in-stage only.
#
# The dist-info count alone would not have caught the pillow defect: a package can
# carry exactly one correct dist-info while stale hash-named payload files ship
# beside the new ones. pillow 12.2.0 and 12.3.0 each vendor 18 differently-hashed
# .so files in pillow.libs and share one path, so a missed whiteout leaves ~17
# stale codec libraries with the metadata still reading clean. The second check
# therefore probes the payload directly: RECORD lists exactly the pillow.libs
# entries the installed wheel owns, so anything on disk beyond that set is a
# survivor from the base image. This mirrors what the DALI guard does -- it
# inspects the libraries, not the version string.
